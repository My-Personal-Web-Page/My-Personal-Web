        <p>As this was my first practice project itâ€™s not very good but you can see the evolution of my work through
          this portfolio. This website demo was built for my novel and showcases the blurb, about the author, and an
          added link you can click to purchase the book. Although the programming is basic my style is still present.

        <h2>My Second Project~</h2>

        <p>My second project, still not too advanced, was created while attending FullStack bootcamp in the Grace Hopper
          division. With a bit more learned experience from the lovely instructors I was able to better design a
          workable website.

        <h2>My Third Project~</h2>

        <p>My Third project and probably my favorite one so far was also cultivated under the instruction of Grace
          Hopper devs. With care and a lot of purple I designed a website to showcase my favorite books, a project this
          nerd can really get behind! Although the summaries are Ipsum Lorem, the tittles are legitimate and the books
          showcased come highly recommended (by me)!
