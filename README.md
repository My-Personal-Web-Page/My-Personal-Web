# My-Personal-Web
This three page website is all about me, from a quote chosen by one of my favorite philosophers to the color palette! A lot of work and many mistakes went into not only the design but the structure of the pages. Although it is not perfect in any way, I really enjoyed working on it. I less enjoyed figuring out how to work GITHUB but thankful for the experience. I know how useful this site will be to me and Iâ€™m grateful.

The site is navigated by the home, about, and portfolio buttons found to the right of the header. The home page will showcase my name and a quote from Plato. 

The About me page has information on my hobbies that I am passionate about, images to visualize said hobbies, and a little summary of what they mean for me. 

The third and final page will be home to three of my projects, one personal and two scholastic, and the images provided -except for the grocery list- were used in their respective sites.
