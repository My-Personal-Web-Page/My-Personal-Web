# My-Personal-Web
This three page website is all about me, from a quote chosen by one of my favorite philosophers to the color palette! A lot of work and many mistakes went into not only the design but the structure of the pages. Although it is not perfect in any way, I really enjoyed working on it. I less enjoyed figuring out how to work GITHUB but thankful for the experience. I know how useful this site will be to me and Iâ€™m grateful.
