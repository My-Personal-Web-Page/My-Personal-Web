        <p>As someone who fiercly enjoys story telling I’ve been interested in the written word since a very young age.
          I started writing for fanfiction.net when I was about twelve and then started a Xanga page as well to showcase
          my stories. In 2017 I had written and published a book titlled Valley of Shadows by C.J Sereda. I have written
          numerous fanfics for many different types of anime which is another strong passion of mine. The anime
          community being one of the sweetest and most welcoming group of people I’ve had the pleasure of joining.

        <p>Painting and art has always been therapeutic to me, a reprieve from reality in a myriad of color. Mixing
          paint and applying textures that make things come to life is probably one of the most satisfying feelings. I
          would not say I’m the most talented artist but everything is this field is relative and personal to the
          person. That’s what I like about it so much, there is no good or bad art. It just is.

        <p>Reading, the great escape, the worlds visited behind your eyes… As an avid reader I can safely say that there
          is immeasurable pleasure when finding a great read. In my opinion a good book can change your life, incite
          strong feelings, and elevate perspective in ways you may have never considered. I can go on forever about my
          favorite Authors and genres, and I hate lending out books. It’s the biggest pet peeve when someone borrows one
          and likes it so much they never return it (although it can also be a good feeling- if not for the loss of my
          precious). Fantasy and historical fiction being my favorites!
